# Image Classification with CIFAR100

# About Dataset
The CIFAR-100 dataset is a collection of 60,000 32x32 colored images divided into 100 fine-grained classes. It's a popular benchmark dataset for image classification tasks, particularly in computer vision research. Here's a breakdown of its key characteristics:

- **Number of Classes**: 100 (fine-grained categories)
- **Number of Images**: 60,000 (50,000 training images, 10,000 testing images)
- **Image Size**: 32x32 pixels (RGB color channels)
- **Class Hierarchy**: The 100 classes are further organized into 20 superclasses (e.g., "mammals", "vehicles", "musical instruments"). Each image has a "fine" label (specific class) and a "coarse" label (superclass).

The fine-grained nature of the classes (e.g., distinguishing between different types of airplanes or dogs) makes CIFAR-100 a more challenging dataset compared to CIFAR-10, which has only 10 object categories.
